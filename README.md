required files to download with pip

1. PyQt5
2. ibm_watson
3. ibm_cloud


Need to setup autenticatior data at ibm watson cloud plateform

# Pre-cautions
Repository contains 2 types of solution : python and dist(exe)
Code usage IBM Watson Api for speech to text and vice versa conversation. In poor internet connectivity problems, Conversation process may take more then 8 secs. 
I suggest conversation of less then 100 characters for fast and successful reply from server. You may change long size file into chunks and call function.
